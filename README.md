## The general framework the app will work with

- There is a condition that must be fulfilled for some form of payment to occur.
  - This can be delivery of goods on time.
  - The person making the delivery taking a predetermined routes without any detour
  - An employee being present for an on-sight job
  - And so much more. I will leave you imagine more scenarios.
- There is a smart-contract that checks if an input is valid by evolving the contract state.
- There is an interface (mobile app) that sends data to the smart-contract
- There is an admin portal where the contract creator can monitor the status.
